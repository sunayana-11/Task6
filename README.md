# Task6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

## Objective:
The goal of this task is to analyze **monthly revenue** and **order volume** using SQL aggregate functions. This helps identify trends in sales performance over time.

---

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL
- CSV (Sample Dataset)

---

## Dataset Used
The dataset used is `sample_orders.csv`, which includes the following columns:
- `order_id` (INT) â€” Unique identifier for each order
- `product_id` (INT) â€” Product involved in the order
- `order_date` (DATE) â€” Date when the order was placed
- `amount` (DECIMAL) â€” Revenue generated by the order

---

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed

1. **Created a Database and Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE sales_data;
   USE sales_data;

   CREATE TABLE orders (
     order_id INT,
     product_id INT,
     order_date DATE,
     amount DECIMAL(10,2)
   );

2. **Imported the Dataset**<br>
   - Used Table Data Import Wizard in MySQL Workbench
   - Loaded sample_orders.csv into the orders table
   
3. **Analyzed Monthly Sales Trends**<br>
   - Grouped data by year and month
   - Calculated total revenue and distinct order volume

   ```sql
   SELECT
     YEAR(order_date) AS year,
     MONTH(order_date) AS month,
     SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
     COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY year, month
   ORDER BY year, month;

4. **Identified Top 3 Months by Revenue**
   ```sql
   SELECT
      YEAR(order_date) AS year,
      MONTH(order_date) AS month,
      SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
      COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY year, month
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
   LIMIT 3;
